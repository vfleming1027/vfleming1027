My name is Victoria Fleming and I am an aerospace engineering major at Iowa State University. My goal is to work with the military on special operations aircraft once I graduate. 
In my free time, I love to watch movies and tv. I am an avid reader as well. 
I very much enjoy any and all sports, whether it be participating or watching. 

I am interested in learning all areas of aerospace, especially those that have to do with systems engineering. 
I am from the Chicagoland area, specifically from Des Plaines which is directly adjacent to O'Hare International airport.
